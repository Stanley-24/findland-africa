# ðŸ’° MVP Cost Analysis â€“ Real Estate Bridging Loan Platform

## Executive Summary

This document provides a detailed cost breakdown for the MVP phase of our Real Estate Bridging Loan platform. The chosen tech stack (React, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, AWS) is flexible and cost-effective for a pilot, with costs primarily usage-based and significantly lower than full-scale operational budgets.

**MVP Monthly Budget Range: $200 - $500**

---

## 1. AWS Infrastructure Costs

### Compute Layer (FastAPI Backend)
- **Service:** AWS EC2 or AWS Fargate
- **Configuration:** 
  - EC2: `t3.medium` instance for pilot
  - Fargate: Serverless containers for auto-scaling
- **Estimated Cost:** $20 - $50/month
- **Scaling Factor:** Largest variable cost as user base grows
- **Notes:** Start small, scale based on actual usage patterns

### Database (PostgreSQL)
- **Service:** AWS RDS (Managed PostgreSQL)
- **Configuration:** `db.t3.micro` or `db.t3.small` instance
- **Estimated Cost:** $15 - $40/month
- **Critical:** Non-negotiable cost for data integrity and reliability
- **Backup:** Automated backups included in RDS pricing

### Storage (S3)
- **Service:** AWS S3 for media and document storage
- **Use Cases:** Property photos, videos, legal documents, user uploads
- **Estimated Cost:** <$5/month initially
- **Scaling:** Costs scale with user media uploads
- **Storage Classes:** Standard for active files, IA for archived documents

### Communication Infrastructure
- **Service:** Twilio for voice/video calls and messaging
- **Pricing Model:** Per-minute for calls, per-message for SMS
- **Estimated Cost:** $100 - $300/month
- **Critical Factor:** Significant cost driver based on feature usage
- **Optimization:** Monitor usage patterns and implement call limits

### Additional AWS Services
- **Route 53 (DNS):** ~$1/month for domain management
- **API Gateway:** Pay-per-request, minimal for pilot
- **CloudFront (CDN):** Performance optimization, ~$5-10/month
- **Total Additional Services:** <$20/month

## 2. Third-Party APIs & Services

### KYC/KYB Verification
- **Services:** NIN, BVN, and CAC verification APIs
- **Pricing:** Per-API call basis
- **Cost Impact:** Small per verification, scales with user onboarding
- **Budget Allocation:** $20-50/month for pilot phase

### Payment Gateway Integration
- **Services:** Flutterwave, Paystack integration
- **Pricing:** Transaction fees (e.g., 1.4% + flat fee for local cards)
- **Cost Model:** Directly tied to revenue (cost of doing business)
- **Note:** This is a revenue-share cost, not operational expense

### Legal & Compliance Software
- **Services:** Contract generation automation tools
- **Pricing:** Per-document fee or subscription model
- **Estimated Cost:** $30-100/month
- **Value:** Reduces manual legal work and ensures compliance

| Category | Monthly Cost Range | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| **AWS Infrastructure** | $140 - $415 | Largest component |
| - Compute (EC2/Fargate) | $20 - $50 | Scales with users |
| - Database (RDS) | $15 - $40 | Critical for reliability |
| - Storage (S3) | <$5 | Scales with uploads |
| - Communication (Twilio) | $100 - $300 | Major variable cost |
| - Other AWS Services | <$20 | DNS, CDN, API Gateway |
| **Third-Party APIs** | $50 - $150 | KYC, legal software |
| **Total MVP Budget** | **$200 - $500** | **Monthly operational cost** |

## 4. Cost Optimization Strategies

### Immediate Optimizations
1. **Start Small:** Begin with minimal viable infrastructure
2. **Monitor Usage:** Track actual usage vs. projections
3. **Auto-scaling:** Implement AWS auto-scaling for cost efficiency
4. **Reserved Instances:** Consider for predictable workloads

### Scaling Considerations
- **Revenue Alignment:** As loan volume increases, infrastructure costs should be covered by transaction fees
- **Break-even Analysis:** Track when revenue exceeds operational costs
- **Cost per Transaction:** Monitor infrastructure cost per loan facilitated

---

## 5. Budget Monitoring & Alerts

### Key Metrics to Track
- Monthly AWS bill breakdown
- Twilio usage and costs
- API call volumes and costs
- Cost per active user
- Cost per loan transaction

### Alert Thresholds
- Set up AWS billing alerts at 80% of budget
- Monitor Twilio usage spikes
- Track unusual API call patterns

---

## 6. Risk Factors

### Cost Overrun Risks
1. **Unexpected Traffic Spikes:** Could increase compute costs significantly
2. **High Communication Usage:** Twilio costs can escalate quickly
3. **Data Storage Growth:** S3 costs scale with user-generated content
4. **API Rate Limits:** May require premium tiers for higher volumes

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Usage Monitoring:** Real-time cost tracking and alerts
2. **Feature Gating:** Limit communication features during pilot
3. **Data Retention Policies:** Implement automatic cleanup of old data
4. **API Optimization:** Cache responses and batch API calls

---

## 7. Next Steps

1. **Set up AWS Cost Monitoring:** Implement billing alerts and dashboards
2. **Create Budget Tracking:** Monthly cost review process
3. **Optimize Based on Usage:** Adjust infrastructure based on actual patterns
4. **Plan for Scale:** Prepare cost projections for growth phases
