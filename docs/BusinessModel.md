## 9. Risks & Mitigation (High-Level)

| Risk Type | Example | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Market | Low trust, fraud, informal agents | Verified listings, physical checks, escrow, insurance |
| Regulatory | CBN/SEC compliance, title verification delays | Partner with Lagos State Lands Bureau, licensed banks, microfinance institutions |
| Operational | Loan defaults, cashflow mismatch | Risk pool, pilot with smaller loan sizes, align repayments to project schedules |
| Technical | Scalability, data security | Modular architecture, cloud hosting, encrypted storage |
| Communication | Data privacy, fraud in chat/media | End-to-end encryption, AI fraud monitoring, call/media audit trail |
| **Cost & Infrastructure** | **AWS cost overruns, Twilio spikes** | **Real-time monitoring, auto-scaling, feature gating** |
| **Financial** | **Revenue vs cost mismatch in early stages** | **Conservative projections, break-even tracking** |

### Critical MVP Watch-Outs
1. **Regulatory Hurdles:** License approvals are go/no-go factor
2. **Trust Deficit:** Single bad actor could kill brand reputation  
3. **Financial Risk:** Few defaults can significantly impact small user base
